**Overview**


This project explores the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business context, focusing on risk analytics in banking and financial services. The goal is to use data-driven insights to identify and mitigate financial risks associated with lending. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior and financial profiles, we aim to support better lending decisions and reduce the likelihood of loan defaults.


**Objectives**


**Apply EDA Techniques**:   Utilize EDA to uncover trends and characteristics that differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters.

**Understand Risk Analytics**:   Develop a foundational understanding of risk management in finance, particularly in customer credit assessment.
Support Data-Driven Lending: Use insights from the analysis to guide lending decisions that minimize financial risk.


**Dataset**


**Source**:   [Loan Defaulters Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter)

**Description**:   The dataset includes attributes relevant to loan applicants, such as their income, loan amount, credit history, and other financial and demographic details. An additional CSV file (columns_description.csv) describes each column's role in the data.


**Key Columns**


**Loan_Status**:   Indicates whether a loan has been defaulted or repaid

**Income**:   The applicant’s income level

**Loan Amount**:   Total amount requested for the loan

**Credit History**:   A record of the applicant's credit repayment history
Employment Type, Age, Marital Status: Additional attributes providing demographic information
These features will be explored to uncover any correlations or trends that can predict loan default likelihood.


**Project Workflow**


**1. Data Loading and Preparation**

**Data Import**:   Load and inspect the dataset.

**Cleaning**:   Handle missing values and data inconsistencies, correct data types, and standardize values where necessary.

**Feature Engineering**:   Create new variables if needed, based on combinations of existing features to improve analysis.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Univariate Analysis**:   Examine each variable individually to identify general trends (e.g., distribution of income levels among defaulters vs. non-defaulters).

**Bivariate Analysis**:   Investigate relationships between variables, such as income vs. loan amount, credit history vs. loan status, etc.

**Visualizations**:   Use matplotlib and seaborn to create visual insights, making it easier to detect patterns and outliers in data.

**Data Distributions**:   Understand the distributions of key variables that might influence loan repayment.

**3. Risk Analysis**

**Correlation Analysis**:   Identify correlations between loan status and potential predictors, such as income and credit history.

**Segmentation Analysis**:   Group applicants based on risk indicators and analyze each segment’s characteristics.

**High-Risk Indicators**:   Highlight attributes or behaviors most commonly associated with loan default to provide actionable insights.

**4. Insights and Recommendations**

**Key Findings**:   Summarize the primary patterns observed in default risk based on EDA.

**Recommendations**:   Provide data-driven suggestions for credit assessment, helping financial institutions mitigate risks associated with high-risk applicants.


**Tools Used**


**Python**:   pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical analysis, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

**Jupyter Notebook**:   An interactive environment for combining code, data, and visualizations


**Results**


Our EDA reveals critical patterns in applicant attributes associated with higher loan default risks, providing a foundation for enhanced decision-making in credit risk assessment. By understanding these risk factors, banks and financial institutions can improve lending policies and make data-informed decisions to minimize financial losses.
